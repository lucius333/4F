</h2>
<hr>
<p style='font-size:10px;'>

<li>Nazism, also spelled Naziism, <br> in full National Socialism, German Nationalsozialismus, totalitarian movement led by Adolf Hitler as head of the Nazi Party in Germany.</li><br><li> In its intense nationalism, mass appeal, and dictatorial rule, Nazism shared many elements with Italian fascism. However, Nazism was far more extreme both in its ideas and in its practice.</li> <br><li> In almost every respect it was an anti-intellectual and atheoretical movement, emphasizing the will of the charismatic dictator as the sole source of inspiration of a people and a nation, as well as a vision of annihilation of all enemies of the Aryan Volk as the one and only goal of Nazi policy.</li>

</h2>
<hr>
<p>

<b><ins>20 April 1889 :</ins></b><br>

    Adolf Hitler is born on April 20th in Braunau am Inn in the empire of Austria-Hungary.</p>

<img src="AHKID.jpg"  Alt=" Adolf Hitler as a child " width="300" height="250"/>

<p>His parents' families are both of poor peasant backgrounds. His father, Alois, regarded as strict and distant, becomes a customs official and expects Adolf to follow a career into the civil service. Hitler’s mother, Klara, is of a more compassionate nature, adoring and indulging her son.</p>

<img src="AHPRNTS.jpg" width="450" height="250"/>

<p>At the age of six Adolf attends school and, while clearly intelligent, he is uninterested in formal education, eventually leaving with a poor educational record of achievement.</p>

<img src="AHAGE6.jpg" width="200" height="200"/>

<p>The death of his father when Adolf was 13, releases the pressure on him to get a job working for the civil service, Adolf is able to pursue his preferred choice of study, that of art. He attends art school and regards himself as an artist, absorbing diverse cultural influences, the opera, theatre, reading and drawing.</p>

<p><b><ins>1907</ins></b><br>

    Hitler moves to Vienna with the aim of attending the Vienna Academy of Art, but his application is rejected. His disappointment is compounded by his failure to also get into the Vienna School of Architecture due to his inability to provide a school-leaving certificate.</p>

<p><b><ins>1909—1913</ins></b><br>

    Without any means of money, Hitler struggles to survive in Vienna, living in a men’s hostel. He sells postcards which he’s drawn, of famous sights, and undertakes a series of menial jobs, to earn money.</p>

<p>During this period of poverty, Hitler engages in much political activity, attending meetings, absorbing political newspapers and literature.</p>

<p><b><ins>1913</ins></b><br>

    Faced with military service for the Habsburg Empire, Hitler takes action to evade this by moving to Munich in Southern Germany. This move is possible in part due to his inheritance of a small legacy from his father’s estate. Here his life continues much as before, until world events changed the course of Hitler’s life.</p>

<p><b><ins>1914</ins></b><br>

    At the outbreak of the First World War, Hitler volunteers for service in the German army and joined the 16th Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment. He distinguishes himself in service, being promoted to corporal and decorated with the Iron Cross for services as a runner on the western front.</p>

<p><b><ins>1919</ins></b><br>

    Intent on remaining in the army, having found real purpose to his life, Hitler is appointed to the Intelligence/Propaganda section where he undertakes political training. His activities involve making speeches to the troops advocating German nationalism and anti-Socialism, where he developed further his oratory skills.</p>

<p><b>He also acts as an army informer, spying on small political parties. He joins the German Workers’ Party, an extreme anti-communist, anti-Semitic right wing organisation.</b></p>

<h2 style="font-size:30px;">Hitler's Entry into Politics : </h2>

<p><b> <ins>1920 </ins></b><br>

Hitler is discharged from the army. In the German Worker’s Party he undertakes responsibility for publicity and propaganda. He changes the party’s name to the National Socialist German Workers Party, (or Nazi for short) The party represents a combination of intense hatred for the politicians who they considered had dishonoured Germany by signing the Versailles Treaty and exploiting local grievances against a weak federal government.</p>

<p>The following day, the Nazis march in the streets, the police open fire. Hitler escapes but is captured, tried for treason and serves 9 months in Landsberg prison. It was during his imprisonment that he began dictating his thoughts to Rudolf Hess, which emerged in the book Mein Kampf (my struggle). It is a mixture of autobiography, political ideology and an examination of the techniques of propaganda.</p>

<p>Crystal Night is considered to be the beginning of the Final Solution and the Holocaust, which you can study in more depth. The mass killing represented by the Holocaust raises many questions concerning the development of European civilisation during the twentieth century.</p>
